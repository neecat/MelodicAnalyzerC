To Compile, make sure you have mingw64 installed and run the build.sh script.
The GNU/Linux version works completely, however, there is no error handling employed
so use with care. I am unable to run the win32 binary properly on my system
as it is 64bit only. Under Virtual Box on WOW64 it loads and produces an bad allocation
error. The win64 version works in my version of Wine but also creates an error when
searching arrays. I did get it to produce a file ONCE but have been unable
to reproduce the circumstances leading to it.

TODO:
      -Debug Windows Version
      -Test on Darwin/OSX
      -Make a GUI with PNG rendering

Known Issues:

      Linux
           1. There is no error handling of any kind.
           2. Note name input is case-sensitive so use upper case letters only.
           3. There must be a space between the note name symbol and the octave indicator. 
      Win32/Win64
           1. Doesn't work... Something in the way my pointers/variables are handled.
 	   2. Note name input is case-sensitive so use upper case letters only.
           3. There must be a space between the note name symbol and the octave indicator. 
      OSX/Darwin
           1. Untested. If you desire to try it, I'd start with the linux source. It might
           just work with out modification. There isn't a good reason why it shouldn't anyways.
